A total of 188 tests (some of the 15 tests actually consist of multiple sub-tests)
were conducted to evaluate the randomness of 5 bitstreams of 1048576 bits from:

	../data-2.txt

The numerous empirical results of these tests were then interpreted with
an examination of the proportion of sequences that pass a statistical test
(proportion analysis) and the distribution of p-values to check for uniformity
(uniformity analysis). The results were the following:

	160/188 tests passed successfully both the analyses.
	28/188 tests did not pass successfully both the analyses.

Here are the results of the single tests:

 - The "Frequency" test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Block Frequency" test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Cumulative Sums" (forward) test FAILED the proportion analysis.
   The "Cumulative Sums" (backward) test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Runs" test FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - The "Longest Run of Ones" test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Binary Matrix Rank" test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Discrete Fourier Transform" test passed both the analyses.

 - 125/148 of the "Non-overlapping Template Matching" tests passed both the analyses.
   23/148 of the "Non-overlapping Template Matching" tests FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - The "Overlapping Template Matching" test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Maurer's Universal Statistical" test passed both the analyses.

 - The "Approximate Entropy" test FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - 8/8 of the "Random Excursions" tests passed both the analyses.

 - 18/18 of the "Random Excursions Variant" tests passed both the analyses.

 - The "Serial" (first) test FAILED the proportion analysis.
   The "Serial" (second) test FAILED the proportion analysis.

 - The "Linear Complexity" test passed both the analyses.

The missing tests (if any) were whether disabled manually by the user or disabled
at run time due to input size requirements not satisfied by this run.
